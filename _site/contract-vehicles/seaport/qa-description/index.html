<h2>Quality Management System</h2>

<h4>General Requirements:</h4>

The System is maintained and continually improved through the execution of the INDUS Quality Policy, Quality Objectives, audit results, analysis of data, corrective and preventive action, and process improvement requests and management reviews. To design and implement the QMS, INDUS has:
</p>

<p>
  Identified the processes needed for the QMS and their application throughout the organization, and documented them in Quality Manual.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Determined the interaction of these processes and illustrated them on the System Interaction Diagram.
  </li>
  <li>
    Determined criteria and methods needed to ensure that the operation and control of the processes are effective, and documented them in quality plans, procedures, work instructions, and measurement plans.
  </li>
  <li>
    Ensured the continuing availability of resources and information necessary to achieve planned results and continual improvement of these processes.
  </li>
  <li>
    Established mechanisms to monitor, measure, and analyze these processes Analysis and Improvement, the INDUS Operation Process Review, and the INDUS Measurement Program Plan).
  </li>
  <li>
    Established procedures to identify and implement actions necessary to achieve planned results and continual improvement.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Documentation Requirements:</h2>

<h4>General:</h4>

<p>

</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    INDUS’ Quality Manual, containing the INDUS Quality Policy and Quality Objectives.
  </li>
  <li>
    Documented Procedures.
  </li>
  <li>
    Documentation identified as needed for the effective planning, operation and control of INDUS processes.
  </li>

</p>

<h4>Control of Documents:</h4>

<p>
  INDUS QMS organizational documents include the INDUS Quality Manual, INDUS Procedures, INDUS forms, checklists, work instructions and templates. INDUS controls QMS documents using the Control of Quality Management System Documents procedure.
</p>

<p>
  Corporate approved and controlled documentation, such as life-cycle models, metrics procedures, purchasing procedures, etc are also used.
</p>

<p>
  Project procedures define the requirements for:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Approving documents for adequacy prior to issue.
  </li>
  <li>
    Reviewing and updating as necessary and re-approving documents (including documents in draft form).
  </li>
  <li>
    Ensuring that changes and current revision status of documents are identified.
  </li>
  <li>
    Ensuring that relevant versions of applicable documents are available at points of use.
  </li>
  <li>
    Ensuring that documents remain legible and readily identifiable.
  </li>
  <li>

  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  Project documentation is controlled according to the customer contract, project plans that are established as part of a project’s planning process, and the Control of Quality Management System Documents procedure. Project procedures are customized to support unique project specific needs as part of the planning process.
</p>

<p>
  Projects are issued external documentation as identified in the Statement of Work and customer contract. Projects identify and control external documentation using the Control of Quality Management System Documents procedure.
</p>

<p>

The pertinent issues of documents and data are available in locations convenient for personnel requiring the information. Recipients of controlled copies of documents are responsible to suitably identify obsolete documents. Archives are maintained for storage of data and documents required to satisfy legal or intellectual data preservation requirements.
</p>

<p>
  Changes to documents are reviewed and approved by the same functions and/or organizations that performed the original review and approval, unless specifically designated otherwise. The designated functions and/or organizations have access to pertinent background information on which to base their review and approval. The nature of the change is identified in the document itself and/or on accompanying routing sheets and change request forms.
</p>

</p>

<p>
  Project QMS records are stored and maintained by projects to demonstrate conformance to customer requirements and the effective operation of the Quality System. Pertinent QMS records from subcontractors are included in these data.
</p>

<p>
  Organizational QMS records are stored so they are readily retrievable for use.
